#+TITLE: Installation instructions

The file lists all steps required to come up with my complete
workspace settings. The main efficiency of the procedure comes from
the fact that I make heavily use of central file management, so that
my system settings are stored in two public git-repos and a private
dropbox folder. 

As the complete setup can be installed easily alongside any existing
operating system, it is highly suitable for temporary trial. The
complete setup should be working in less than two hours, and can be
completely removed from the system within a few mouse clicks.

Hence, do not be afraid to try!

* TODO Enable workspace configuration without private dropbox files
One main goal for the future is to create installation instructions
that avoid all my private data files, but come up with a completely
working similar working environment, too. This could be used to set
up an identical environment for others.
Therefore, I should make too public dropbox folders similarly to my
own private data files, containing some examblary settings.



* Ubuntu installation
The installation described will use Ubuntu alongside an existing
Windows installation. 
- press F12 on computer startup to get to boot menu
- start system from USB stick
- check "download updates" and "install third-party software"
- check "install alongside"

** Adjusting Ubuntu system settings
- make Caps lock an alternative Ctrl key: system settings / keyboard
  layout
