#+TITLE: Learning Emacs


* Structure
The general structure here will be as follows:
- individual emacs extensions will be covered in extern files
- installation instructions will be tackled
- one part is for collection of internet resources only
- each entry at best shall possess the following attributes:
  - correct location in hierarchical structure
  - shortcut tag in lines containing keyboard bindings
  - link to original reference
  - source code block
  - inactivate timestamp
- inbox bucket for captured notes
- future improvement suggestions -> todo items

* Installation
- download emacs-24.2.tar.gz
- extract to $HOME (home folder must be visible on right side, without
  contents)
- rename emacs-24.2 to emacs
- run configure script using prefix to determine the location of
  architecture independent files: ./configure --prefix=$HOME/emacs
- make
- -> emacs executable should work: try src/emacs -Q
- make install
- make clean
** Problem
Work PC does not automatically support windows, because it does not
find the right paths. Hence, I had to run the configuration script
with additional option:
#+begin_src sh
./configure --without-x
#+end_src
Also, I additional had to install lbincurses with software center even
prior to ./configure.

** GTK+ installation
Problem: my Ubuntu did not include GTK+ by default. Hence, emacs will
not start in an own window.
- libncurses5-dev is needed also
 
* org installation
- download newest stable version from orgmode.org (currently 7.9.1)
- follow instructions of org-mode manual, section 1.2: Installation:
  - unpack archive to ~/.emacs.d/org 
  - run /make help config/ to check paths (org shall nevertheless be
    installed in /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/org)
  - adapt paths in local.mk
  - run /make config/
  - run /sudo make install/
  - in init.el, add:
    - (add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/org")
    - (require 'org-install)
  - if you want to use uncompiled repositories instead:
    - (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/org/lisp")
    - (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/org/contrib/lisp")
    - (require 'org-install)
  - require should automatically load org-mode at startup, which is
    okay, since I use it always anyway

* ESS installation
- download ess
- extract
- move to /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/ess
- in init.el, include
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/ess/lisp")
(require 'ess-site)
#+end_src
* w3m installation
- install w3m with emacs-extension from software center
- test w3m in terminal
- 
* Captured notes
** el-get description
El-get is tool that allows downloading external scripts/extensions for Emacs, install them for you, knows how to update them
and init them, care about load-path and Info-directory-list, byte-compile what should be, manages autoloads, etc.
