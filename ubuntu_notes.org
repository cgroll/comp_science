* Removing Ubuntu with windows ( [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DAAWBZq04Izc][video tutorial]] )
In order to remove Ubuntu completely, two steps are necessary. First,
Ubuntu has to be removed, and second, the GNU Grub bootloader has to
be removed. The Grub bootloader is the menu which appears at startup
and let's you choose your operating system. However, when you plan to
stay with a dual operating system setting, the GNU Grub needs not be
removed. 
** Removing systems other than windows
- right click on computer (Arbeitsplatz)
- manage (verwalten)
- delete partitions associated with other operating systems
  - this of course is the critical step, since choosing the wrong
    partition inrevertably would kill your data!
** Removing Grub
- this could be done with a program called EasyBCD
