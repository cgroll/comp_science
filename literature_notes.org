#+TITLE: Literature management with org-mode and git

* Requirements
The requirements for a sophisticated literature management system are
threefold:
- literature shall be manageable with hierarchical structure and as
  many cross-links as possible
- all files ideally should be stored locally, which necessitates some
  way of efficiently synchronizing all files over multiple computers
- comments and annotations shall be possible and sync'ed over
  computers, too

* Solution
My solution looks as follows:
- each piece of literature gets an entry in an org-mode file with
  hierarchical structure and in a bibtex file:
  - information about title will be stored in property entries
  - additional cross-references can be tackled through tags and links
  - org-mode file and associated bibtex entries can be kept in dropbox
    folder
- all literature pdfs and other files are kept in one folder as git
  repository:
  - file names should include bibtex key and short title description
  - git repository should have remote repo on server: since repo will
    become rather large over time, I use a server instead of Dropbox
    to sync
- annotations are made by okular and are sync'ed via dropbox between
  computers

* git setup

* mendeley desktop
** configuration
- show bibtex entry for all kinds
- enable sync'ed bibtex entry to
  ~/Dropbox/literature/management_files/library.bib (keys are created
  according to author/year)
- allow mendeley to organize your files in local folder: this will
  copy pdf-files to ~/literature/
- remark: do not automatically rename files!! Given that file name is
  already correct, but file is not correctly identified by mendeley,
  it will rename it to false settings!
