#+TITLE: Secure connections through ssh

* [[http://www.lrz.de/services/pki/einf/][Encryption and security: LRZ]]
** Goals
- privacy: make message unreadable to third persons
- authentification: is the specified sender the real sender
- unchanged: guarantee unchanged and unmanipulated messages


* Telnet 
- everything that you send or receive over that telnet

- anyone who can "sniff" the connection in-between can see
  your username, password
