These are the notes for the freely available book "Pro Git".

** Getting started
- Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of
  files over time so that you can recall specific versions later
- Centralized version control: If that server goes down for an hour,
  then during that hour nobody can collaborate at all or save
  versioned changes to anything 
- Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, it
  basically takes a picture of what all your files look like
- Git doesn’t need to go out to the server to get the history
- If you get on an airplane or a train and want to do a little work,
  you can commit happily until you get to a network connection to
  upload.
- Git has three main states that your files can reside in: committed,
  modified, and staged.
- *Committed*: data is safely stored in your local database
- *Modified*: changed file, but not committed to database yet.
- *Staged*: marked modified file in its current version to go into next
  commit snapshot.
- Git directory :: where Git stores the metadata and object database 
- working directory :: a single checkout of one version of the project
     placed on disk for you to use or modify
- staging area :: a simple file that stores information about what
                  will go into your next commit
*** installation:
- instructions of book differed in step "grab latest snapshot from http://git-scm.com/download"
- simply used installation for linux recommended on webpage
#+begin_src sh
sudo apt-get install git-core
#+end_src
- consequence: no influence on installation file path
- git not installed as git-repository?
- configure git: for
  - complete system
  - complete user
  - individual repository only
- create .gitconfig file for user configuration
#+begin_src sh
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
git config --global core.editor emacs
git config --global merge.tool meld
#+end_src
- leading to following file content
#+begin_src file_content
[user]
	name = John Doe
	email = johndoe@example.com
[core]
	editor = emacs
[merge]
	tool = meld
#+end_src

** Git Basics
*** create git repository for existing files in project folder
- go to project directory
- starting to track an existing project: create subdirectory named
  .git
#+begin_src sh
git init
#+end_src
